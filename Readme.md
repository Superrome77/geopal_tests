I was not able to get the hover over element to work for task 2 
I also cannot get my JAVA_HOME PATH variable correct and therefore cannot view the allure report, however I think it was still generated and can be found in the output folder
Other than these two blockers I enjoyed the assignment and am more comfortable working with CodeceptJS.
Thank you for giving me this opportunity, any feedback is greatly appreciated.
